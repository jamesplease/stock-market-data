## Updating the Data

Robert Shiller updates the data on his [website](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm). Follow these
instructions to update the data in this package:

1. download the data ([direct download link](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls))
2. open the file in Excel or Numbers
3. export the `data` tab as a CSV file with the filename `ie_data.csv`
4. replace the `ie_data.csv` file in the root of this project with your new csv file

That's it! Open a PR, and I'll get it merged and released.

One last thing â€“ thanks again!
