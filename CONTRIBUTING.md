## Updating the Data

Robert Shiller updates the data on his [website](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm). Follow these
instructions to update the data in this package:

1. download the data ([direct download link](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls))
2. replace the `ie_data.xls` file in the root of this project with the new xls file

That's it! Open a PR, and I'll get it merged and released.

One last thing â€“ thanks again!
