Hi James! I noticed that the data has gotten a little bit stale. If you have time, would you be able to pull down the latest data?

If you're a bit busy, I understand. If I have time I might try [updating the data myself](https://github.com/jamesplease/stock-market-data/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and opening a PR.

Thanks for reading!
